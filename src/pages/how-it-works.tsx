              <h3>NO Deadlines or Mandatory Classes</h3>
              <p>
              You’ll never be on the clock to finish your assignments.  You have a full two years to complete any training program, so there’s no rush and plenty of time if life gets in the way! (as a reference point, the average program completion time is 3-6 months)

              <h3>A hands-on approach</h3>
              <p>
              Some people have trouble understanding how you can learn a practical skill online.  The answer is, your online training has to follow the same kind of hands-on methods as you’ll get in the classroom.  Your training assignments will be a mix of theoretical and practical. Depending on the program you take, “practical” can mean anything from completing thorough case studies or real-world scenarios to actually completing a full makeup application or grooming a live dog!

              <h3>100% Personalized Tutor Feedback</h3>
              <p>
              All your assignments will be graded by a live tutor, who is a working professional in the industry you’re studying.  Your tutor will provide you with detailed audio feedback on your work, indicating your strengths and also the areas where you need to improve.  This unique approach to providing constructive feedback is how QC students graduate way ahead of the curve in all programs.
